<p> This is my seventeenth straight day without </p> <div class="sleep"> sleep. </div> 

<p> I’m not talking about </p> 

<div class="insomnia">
insomnia. </div> 

<p> I know what </p> 

<div class="insomnia"> insomnia </div>

 <p> is. I had something like it in college―something like it because I’m not sure that what I had then was exactly the same as what people refer to as </p>
 <div class="insomnia"> insomnia. </div> 

 <p> I suppose a doctor could have told me. But I didn’t see a doctor. I knew it wouldn’t do any good. Not that I had any reason to think so. Call it woman’s intuition―I just felt they couldn’t help me. So I didn’t see a doctor, and I didn’t say anything to my parents or friends, because I knew that that was exactly what they would tell me to do.

Back then, my “something like </p>

<div class="insomnia"> insomnia </div> <p> ” went on for a month. I never really got to sleep that entire time. I’d go to bed at night and say to myself, “All right now, time for some sleep.” That was all it took to wake me up. It was instantaneous - like a conditioned reflex. The harder I worked at sleeping, the wider awake I became. I tried alcohol, I tried sleeping pills, but they had absolutely no effect.
