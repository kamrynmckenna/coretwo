                                            It was the 
                                              shadow of      
                                               myself. Weird,
                                                I would think as      
                                                  the drowsiness 
                                                  overtook me, Iâ€™m    
                                                        in my own 
                                                   shadow. I would     
                                                 walk and eat and
                                                   talk to people       
                                                     inside my  
                                             drowsiness. And the
                                           strangest thing was  
                                       that no one noticed. I 
                                      lost fifteen pounds
                                that month, and no one 
                         noticed. No one in my 
                  family, not one of my 
		friends realized.
