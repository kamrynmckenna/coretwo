      on        the 


 other 		side 		of 		a 				transparent


   wall,			 watching		 me.	     My   physical   	self


was    		drifting 			through 	  the 


		feeble 			morning 					 light, 


 and 



      all 			the 		while 			I 


  could 	 	feel 			my 			mind staring, 		breathing,


close			 beside 			it.	 I 		was 		both a 


	body 		on




 the 		 verge 			of 					sleep	 and 	


 a 		mind determined 		to 		stay 			awake. 


		This 			incomplete  	drowsiness		 would 	


			continue 


on 		and 		off 		all 		day. 		My 	head 


	was			always	foggy. 			I 	couldn’t 	get 	an 


	accurate 		fix 		on 						the


things	 around 		me―their 		distance 	or mass	


			 or tenure. The 


		drowsiness 			would			 overtake 	


	me at 


regular, 		wavelike 


		intervals: 				on the 		subway,		 in the 


	classroom, 					at 


the 						dinner			 table. 		My


			 mind 			would		 slip 			away 


from 		my 		body. 			The 	world		 would


	sway 			soundlessly. I 			would

	
 		drop 					things.
