               Back then, my 
          “something like
      insomnia” went on for 
   a month. I never really 
got to sleep that entire
 time. I’d go to bed at 
night and say to myself,
“All right now, time for
some sleep.” That was
all it took to wake me up. 
It was instantaneous - like
a conditioned reflex. The 
harder I worked at sleeping,
 the wider awake I became. I
   tried alcohol, I tried sleeping 
        pills, but they had absolutely
              no effect.
