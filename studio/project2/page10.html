“Hold tight,”
 I would tell myself,
 but there was nothing for me
 to hold on to.

And then, when night came, the intense wakefulness 
would return. I was powerless to resist it. I was 
locked in its core by an enormous force. All I could 
do was stay awake until morning, eyes wide open in the 
dark. I couldn’t even think. As I lay there, listening 
to the clock tick off the seconds, I did nothing but
stare at the darkness as it slowly deepened 
and slowly diminished.
