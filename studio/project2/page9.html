                         It was literally true: I
                            was going through life 
                              asleep. My body had no 
                                     more feeling than a 
                                   drowned corpse. My very
                                      existence, my life in the
                                           world, seemed like a
                                  hallucination. A strong wind
                                    would make me think my
                                     body was about to be 
                                 blown to the end of the 
                               earth, to some land I had 
                        never seen or heard of, where
                           my mind and body would 
                                separate forever.
