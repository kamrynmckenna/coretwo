                 Finally, as
                the sky 
            began to 
        grow light in 
      the morning, 
     I’d feel that I
    might be
    drifting off.
   But this wasn’t
    sleep. My 
     fingertips were 
      just barely
        brushing 
          against the 
             outermost edge 
                of sleep. And all the
                      while my mind was
                            wide-awake. I would feel a 
                                   hint of drowsiness
